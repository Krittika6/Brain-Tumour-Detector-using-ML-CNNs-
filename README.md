# Brain-Tumour-Detector-using-ML-CNNs-
A project which aims to detect tumours in images of the brain obtained by MRI scans. A dataset consisting of images labelled as "Tumour" and "No Tumour", i.e., binary classification, is used to train the model. Convoluted Neural Networks are used for the same.
